# **Learning How To Learn**

## **An inspirational single page website that helps new web-developers**

---

This project was created as part of a course I've taken with Yandex Practicum100,

Created with:

1. Html.
2. CSS.
3. BEM Methodology.

****No plugins required!**** just download and run it and let me know what you think :)

Future plans:

- Adding additional components like Navigation, a fully working form.
- Adding full reponsivity to the website so it'll look amazing for mobile as well as desktop.
- I'm open to all suggestions!
